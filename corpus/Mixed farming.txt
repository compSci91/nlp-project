Mixed farming is a type of farming which involves both the growing of crops as well as the raising of livestock. This type of farming is mostly practiced in continents like Asia and countries like India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Afghanistan, China and Russia. It was first mainly used for self-consumption, but now in countries like US, Japan, etc., this is done for a commercial purpose.

Cultivation of crops along with rearing of animals for meat or milk is called Mixed Farming. For example, the same farm may grow cereal crops, and keep cattle, sheep, pigs or poultry.

In mixed farming, along with farming some other agriculture based practices are also carried out.

Often the dung from the cattle is used to fertilize the cereal crops. Before horses were used for haulage, many young male cattle were often not butchered as surplus for meat but castrated and used as bullocks to haul the cart and the plough.
